# Amiga500-Mod-PCB-Project
A small back panel PCB to house HDMI and several switches...
This small 4-layer PCB will take an HDMI mini cable from a Raspberry Pi RGB-to-HDMI and convert to normal size HDMI for plugging into the Amiga.
There is one small SPST push-button switch to allow menu access to the Raspberry Pi by way of a 2-pin 100mil spaced header.
A miniture DPDT switch is wired to a 4-pin 100mil header to allow the Amiga-Kit DF0/DF1 select switch cable to plug right in.
A miniture 3PDT switch is wired to a 4-pin 100mil header to allow access to the Amiga Audio Filter Mod as described in my YouTube video.
The Audio Filter control either lets the Amiga control the output low-pass filters, or overrides the Amiga and forces the filters to be enabled/disabled.
The PCB is just barely wide enough to fit in the blank space on the left side of the A500 when looking at the back.
This is my first GitHub repository, so please be patient with me!
